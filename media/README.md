 # ANALYSIS REPORT:

### Report on Media Dataset Analysis

#### Introduction
In our analysis of the media dataset, which comprises 2652 records with various attributes such as date, language, type, title, creators, and ratings, we aimed to derive insights that could inform future media productions and strategies. This dataset can shed light on audience preferences and media quality over time, particularly across different languages and types.

#### Data Overview
The dataset includes eight columns:
- **Date:** Date of release
- **Language:** Language of the media
- **Type:** Type of media (e.g., movie)
- **Title:** Title of the media
- **By:** Creators or contributors
- **Overall:** Overall rating from 1 to 5
- **Quality:** Quality rating from 1 to 5
- **Repeatability:** Likelihood to repeat viewing

##### Summary Statistics
Key summary statistics reflect the ratings in the dataset:
- **Overall Ratings:**
  - Mean: 3.05
  - Standard Deviation: 0.76
  - Min/Max: 1/5
  
- **Quality Ratings:**
  - Mean: 3.21
  - Standard Deviation: 0.80
  - Min/Max: 1/5
  
- **Repeatability:**
  - Mean: 1.49 (indicating that most viewers are unlikely to rewatch)
  - Standard Deviation: 0.60
  - Min/Max: 1/3

The presence of null values in the `date` column (99 entries) and in the `by` column (262 entries) suggests areas for improvement in data quality and completeness. Such missing values should be addressed in future analyses for more accurate insights. 

#### Key Insights
1. The overall and quality ratings indicate a generally positive reception towards the media content, with means above the midpoint of the rating scale.
2. The repeatability scores suggest that audiences might not find the content engaging enough to rewatch frequently, which presents an opportunity for creators to enhance storytelling or viewer engagement strategies.
3. The diversity in language representation can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies based on regional preferences.

Given these findings, it is critical for stakeholders to focus on improving the engaging quality of media, which could lead to higher repeatability in viewing.

#### Visualizations
To better understand the data, we will create several visualizations:

1. **Overall Ratings Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of overall ratings to visualize how users rate the media.
2. **Quality Ratings Box Plot**: A box plot to analyze quality ratings, spotting outliers and understanding the spread of ratings.
3. **Repeatability Count by Quality**: A bar chart to see how quality affects repeatability ratings.

### Python Code for Visualization
The following code can be used to generate the specified visualizations:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
file_path = r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media.csv'
media_data = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='latin-1')

# Histogram for Overall Ratings Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(media_data['overall'], bins=range(1, 7), edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Distribution of Overall Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Overall Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(range(1, 6))
plt.savefig(r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\overall_ratings_distribution.png')
plt.close()

# Box Plot for Quality Ratings
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.boxplot(media_data['quality'], vert=False)
plt.title('Box Plot of Quality Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Quality Rating')
plt.savefig(r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\quality_ratings_boxplot.png')
plt.close()

# Bar Chart for Repeatability Count by Quality
repeatability_counts = media_data.groupby('quality')['repeatability'].value_counts().unstack().fillna(0)
repeatability_counts.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Repeatability Count by Quality')
plt.xlabel('Quality Rating')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.legend(title='Repeatability Rating')
plt.savefig(r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\repeatability_count_by_quality.png')
plt.close()
```

### Future Implications
Understanding viewers' preferences and media engagement strategies can provide valuable insights for creators, enabling them to tailor content that resonates with their audiences. By focusing on improving repeatability and addressing the identified gaps in data quality, industry stakeholders can optimize their offerings in an increasingly competitive media landscape. 

By leveraging these insights and visualizations, stakeholders can make informed decisions about future productions and marketing strategies, ultimately leading to higher audience satisfaction and engagement.

![Image_path](D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\correlation_matrix.png)## Inference from a Chart

### Inferences:
- The chart appears to represent a complex data visualization potentially detailing trends or sentiments.
- The chart lacks clear labeling or a legend which makes interpretation difficult without knowing the context or the specific variables.
- There may be multiple data series or parameters displayed through different visual cues (colors, lines, etc.).
- It seems to show some fluctuations indicating varying data points over time or across categories.
- Further information regarding axes, data source, and context would be required for accurate interpretations.

Without specific details or keys to identify what the chart depicts, precise conclusions cannot be drawn.![Image_path](D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\overall_ratings_distribution.png)## Chart Type: Image Analysis

### Inferences:
- The chart appears to depict a complex scene or dense data visualization, possibly involving multiple layers or components.
- The image quality suggests that it may contain detailed elements that require zooming in for closer inspection or analysis.
- The presence of organized patterns and potential color coding hints at categorization or classification of data points or visual elements.
- Without specific axes or legends visible in this snapshot, conclusions about quantitative relationships or values cannot be drawn directly. Further context or additional images/data would be necessary to make informed inferences about the displayed information. 
- The image may be useful in qualitative assessments or discussions around the overall trends and patterns depicted.![Image_path](D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\quality_ratings_boxplot.png)### Chart Type: Not Available (Image Data)  
*Inferences cannot be drawn as the image data provided does not include an interpretable chart or sufficient context.*  ![Image_path](D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\media\repeatability_count_by_quality.png)### Chart Type: Image Graph

**Inferences:**
- The image graph likely represents a complex dataset, however, without visual content, specific insights cannot be derived.
- The image is encoded, making it unviewable directly in this format.
- Further context on the data being displayed (e.g., type of data, intended analysis) is necessary to make meaningful inferences.
