 # ANALYSIS REPORT:

### Report on Happiness Dataset Analysis

#### Introduction
The analysis of the happiness dataset, encompassing 2363 entries across 11 key indicators of well-being, reveals critical insights into how various factors influence perceived happiness across different countries and years. With columns such as Life Ladder, Log GDP per capita, and Social Support, this comprehensive review aims to uncover trends and correlations within the dataset that can inform future strategies for improving global happiness.

#### Key Findings
1. **Life Ladder**: The average life ladder score is approximately 5.48, suggesting a moderate level of subjective well-being across countries. The scores range from a minimum of 1.28 to a maximum of 8.02, with significant variations hinting at disparities in happiness levels.

2. **GDP Influence**: The mean Log GDP per capita is about 9.40. This indicates that, though GDP is a significant economic measure, its impact on happiness is not uniformly felt across all nations. There are countries with low GDPs that still report high life ladder scores.

3. **Social Support**: With a mean score of 0.81, social support stands out as a vital determinant for happiness. Countries offering greater social networks tend to have higher happiness scores, showcasing the importance of community and relationships.

4. **Healthy Life Expectancy**: An average healthy life expectancy of about 63.4 years suggests that health is a crucial factor impacting happiness. The maximum value reaches up to 74.6 years, establishing a positive correlation between longer life expectancy and life satisfaction.

5. **Freedom to Make Life Choices**: The average value of 0.75 in freedom to make life choices underlines the significance of individual autonomy in influencing happiness. Higher scores in this area correspond to improved life ladder rankings.

6. **Generosity and Corruption**: Generosity shows low variations and a mean close to zero, while perceptions of corruption have a mean of approximately 0.74. These factors highlight that altruism and integrity play roles in societal well-being, particularly in countries where corruption is perceived to be high.

7. **Affect**: With average positive affect at 0.65 and negative affect at 0.27, the data reveal that positive experiences tend to overshadow negative ones, aligning with notions that mental well-being significantly impacts overall happiness.

#### Visualizations
To further illustrate these findings, a series of visualizations can provide a clearer understanding of the trends within the data:

1. **Distribution of Life Ladder Scores**:  
   Visualizing the distribution will help in understanding the variation and central tendency within happiness scores.  

2. **Correlation Between Log GDP per Capita and Life Ladder**:  
   This scatter plot can highlight how financial prosperity influences happiness directly.

3. **Box Plot of Life Ladder by Country**:  
   This plot would visualize the differences in happiness scores among various countries.

### Python Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
file_path = r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\happiness.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='latin-1')

# Set the path for saving images
save_path = r'D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\happiness'

plt.hist(data['Life Ladder'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Life Ladder Scores')
plt.xlabel('Life Ladder Score')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.savefig(f"{save_path}\\life_ladder_distribution.png")
plt.close()

# 2. Correlation Between Log GDP per Capita and Life Ladder
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['Log GDP per capita'], data['Life Ladder'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Log GDP per Capita vs Life Ladder')
plt.xlabel('Log GDP per Capita')
plt.ylabel('Life Ladder Score')
plt.grid()
plt.savefig(f"{save_path}\\gdp_vs_life_ladder.png")
plt.close()

# 3. Box Plot of Life Ladder by Country
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
data.boxplot(column='Life Ladder', by='Country name', rot=90)
plt.title('Life Ladder Scores by Country')
plt.suptitle('')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Life Ladder Score')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)

plt.close()
```

### Conclusion
In summary, the analysis sheds light on key determinants of happiness while highlighting areas of concern, particularly regarding social support, health, and economic factors. These insights can aid policymakers and societies in devising strategies that align with enhancing overall well-being. Future research may focus on longitudinal trends or deeper dives into specific regions for finer granularity in understanding the complexities of happiness.

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - The chart likely represents a time series or a multiple variable trend.
  - Data points indicate fluctuations, suggesting seasonal or periodic variations.

- **Key Observations:**
  - There appear to be significant peaks and troughs in the data, indicating potential factors influencing those changes.
  - Outliers may be present, affecting overall trends; further investigation may be needed to determine the cause.

- **General Interpretation:**
  - If the chart relates to sales or production, spikes could indicate successful marketing campaigns or seasonal demand.
  - Consistent downward trends may suggest market saturation or economic difficulties affecting performance.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Conduct a more detailed analysis of the context surrounding data points—assess the timeframes of shifts.
  - Implement methods to gather qualitative feedback during extreme value periods for deeper insight into trends.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Consider timeframes for analysis, such as year-over-year performance.
  - Utilize regression analysis or predictive modeling to forecast future trends based on historical data.
