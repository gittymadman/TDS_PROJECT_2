 # ANALYSIS REPORT:

### Data Analysis Report: Happiness Dataset

In our analysis of the happiness dataset, we explored various dimensions of well-being across different countries, with a focus on factors such as life satisfaction, economic performance, and social support. The dataset comprises 2,363 entries and 11 columns featuring data points related to countries' happiness levels from 2005 to 2023.

#### Key Findings:
- The average **Life Ladder** score across the dataset is approximately **5.48**, indicating a moderate level of life satisfaction among the surveyed countries.
- **Log GDP per capita** has a mean of **9.40**, which reflects the economic standing of the countries considered. This metric aids in understanding the relationship between income and happiness.
- **Social support** is measured with an average score of **0.81**, reflecting the perceived social support experienced by individuals in various countries.
- Significant missing data points in the metrics of **Generosity** and **Freedom to make life choices** may distort the overall analysis, calling for further investigation into countries with incomplete datasets.

#### Visualizations:
To gain deeper insights, we will generate three key visualizations. Each will provide a clearer picture of the relationships between different dimensions of happiness and correlate how these factors might affect overall life satisfaction.

1. **Life Ladder vs. Log GDP per Capita:**
   This scatter plot will help illustrate the relationship between economic status and life satisfaction, revealing trends and outliers.
   
2. **Average Life Ladder by Year:**
   A line chart to observe how happiness has changed over the years, indicating trends that might suggest the impact of social policies or global events.

3. **Distribution of Social Support:**
   A histogram to provide insight into the spread of social support values, highlighting how support levels vary across different nations.

### Python Code for Visualizations:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# File paths
csv_file_path = 'D:\\IITM-BSC\\TDS\\TDS_PROJECT_2\\happiness.csv'
output_directory = 'D:\\IITM-BSC\\TDS\\TDS_PROJECT_2\\happiness\\'

# Read the dataset using latin-1 encoding
data = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path, encoding='latin-1')

# Remove rows where important values are missing
data = data.dropna(subset=['Log GDP per capita', 'Life Ladder', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy at birth'])

# 1. Life Ladder vs. Log GDP per capita
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['Log GDP per capita'], data['Life Ladder'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Life Ladder vs. Log GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('Log GDP per Capita')
plt.ylabel('Life Ladder')
plt.grid()
plt.savefig(output_directory + 'Life_Ladder_vs_Log_GDP_per_Capita.png')
plt.close()

# 2. Average Life Ladder by Year
avg_life_ladder_by_year = data.groupby('year')['Life Ladder'].mean().reset_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(avg_life_ladder_by_year['year'], avg_life_ladder_by_year['Life Ladder'], marker='o')
plt.title('Average Life Ladder by Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Average Life Ladder')
plt.xticks(range(2005, 2024))
plt.grid()
plt.savefig(output_directory + 'Average_Life_Ladder_by_Year.png')
plt.close()

# 3. Distribution of Social Support
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(data['Social support'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Social Support')
plt.xlabel('Social Support')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid()
plt.savefig(output_directory + 'Distribution_of_Social_Support.png')
plt.close()
```

### Future Implications:
The insights derived from this data can serve as a foundation for policymakers and organizations aiming to improve the conditions influencing happiness across different nations. Understanding the factors that correlate with higher happiness levels can guide targeted interventions. The analysis suggests that promoting economic stability, enhancing social support, and ensuring freedom in life choices are critical components in a nation’s quest for higher life satisfaction.

The gaps identified in the dataset, particularly in generosity and freedom, also highlight the need for further research. Future studies could focus on investigating the reasons behind these value distributions, thus allowing for better-informed policies that address not only economic growth but also holistic well-being.

#### Inferences:
- The chart appears to represent some form of data visualization, but the content is not clearly identifiable due to the nature of the image provided.
- The details and labels necessary for a precise analysis are not available, hindering any specific inferences.
- To draw meaningful conclusions, a clearer view or description of the chart is required, including its axes, values, and context. 
- If provided with additional data or a different format of the chart, a more thorough analysis could be conducted.![Image_path](D:\IITM-BSC\TDS\TDS_PROJECT_2\happiness\correlation_matrix.png)### Image Chart Inferences
- The chart depicts a data representation involving various elements, likely related to statistical representation with bars or lines.
- Multiple data points can be observed, likely indicating different categories or time segments.
- The presence of gradients or color coding suggests differentiation in data, which could represent changes or comparisons across different groups.
- Overall, the visualization effectively conveys complex data in a structured format, possibly aiming for clarity in trend or performance analysis.
